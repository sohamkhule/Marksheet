School Marksheet → AI Insights Generator
________________________________________
1. Introduction
The School Marksheet → AI Insights Generator is a data analytics and AI-powered application designed to automate the analysis of academic marksheets used by schools.
The system converts raw marksheet files (Excel, CSV, or PDF) into structured analytics and generates meaningful insights for teachers and school administrators.
The primary goal of this project is to reduce manual effort, avoid calculation errors, and provide data-driven academic insights in a user-friendly manner.

2. System Architecture	
The application follows a modular architecture, where each component has a single responsibility. This improves maintainability, scalability, and clarity.
Core Modules
1.	app.py
o	Acts as the main entry point.
o	Handles the Streamlit UI and user workflow.
o	Coordinates data flow between modules.
2.	parser.py
o	Responsible for reading marksheet files.
o	Supports Excel, CSV, and PDF formats.
o	Automatically detects header rows.
o	Cleans empty rows and columns.
o	Normalizes inconsistent column names.
o	Performs auto column detection (roll no, name, attendance, subjects).
3.	analysis.py
o	Performs statistical computations.
o	Calculates student-wise metrics such as total marks, average marks, and weak student flags.
o	Computes subject-wise averages.
o	Generates class-level summaries.
4.	insights_llm.py
o	Builds structured context from numeric analysis.
o	Integrates AI models to generate human-readable insights.
o	Supports Gemini API, Hugging Face models, and fallback logic.

3. Data Flow
The system follows a clear end-to-end data pipeline:
1.	User uploads a marksheet file.
2.	File is parsed and cleaned using the parser module.
3.	Columns are auto-detected and shown to the user for verification.
4.	Confirmed columns are passed to the analysis module.
5.	Statistical metrics are calculated.
6.	A structured summary is built.
7.	AI generates a narrative insights report.
8.	Results are displayed in the Streamlit UI.
This ensures transparency, accuracy, and reliability at every stage.

4. Column Detection Strategy
Since school marksheets vary widely in format, the system uses a hybrid detection strategy:
•	Keyword matching for roll number, name, and attendance columns.
•	Numeric validation to detect subject columns.
•	Threshold checks to exclude ID-like numeric columns.
•	Manual override via UI for full flexibility.
This approach balances automation with human verification.

5. AI Usage
Purpose of AI
AI is used to transform numeric statistics into teacher-friendly, actionable insights, rather than raw numbers.
AI Inputs
The AI model receives a structured context containing:
•	Class average
•	Number of students
•	Weak student count
•	Subject-wise averages
•	Top and weak performers
AI Outputs
The generated report includes:
•	Overall performance summary
•	Identification of weak subjects
•	Strong subject recognition
•	Actionable teaching recommendations
Supported AI Options
•	Google Gemini API
•	Hugging Face Inference API
•	Fallback static insights (if no API is configured)
The fallback mechanism ensures that the application never fails to generate insights, even in offline or API-limited environments.

6. User Interface Design
The UI is built using Streamlit with a step-by-step workflow:
1.	File upload and preview
2.	Automatic column detection display
3.	Manual column confirmation
4.	Analytics dashboard
5.	AI insights generation
This design prioritizes clarity, usability, and error prevention.

7. Limitations
Despite its robustness, the system has some limitations:
•	PDF table extraction accuracy depends on the PDF structure.
•	AI insight quality depends on the quality of input data.
•	Currently supports analysis of a single class at a time.
•	No built-in authentication or role management.
These limitations are acceptable for a prototype and internship-level project.

8. Future Improvements
The project can be extended in several ways:
•	Export reports as PDF or Excel.
•	Student-wise personalized feedback.
•	Multi-class and multi-year performance comparison.
•	Predictive analytics for student performance.
•	Integration with school management systems.
•	Cloud deployment with authentication and user roles.
